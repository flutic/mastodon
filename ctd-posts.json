The only disappointment was the starting Genetic Psychics who should have been able to make use of the vast numbers of green dice I accumulated but I just couldn‚Äôt find any 6+ developments.

The chosen title was the second coming of the Wisden Cricket Monthly ‚Äî a periodical I used to subscribe to in the 80s, and had (for a while) every single issue. It is fascinating to see how it has addressed the changed environment we live in now. The old WCM would devote at least 1/3 of the contents to match reports and other statistics. The new one has none at all, though to be honest this could be because of the pandemic! They did have some photos from the first Test match between England and West Indies at Southampton earlier this month, but perhaps they will have reports next month. The focus is much more on good articles on all aspects of the game rather than scorecards, which, of course, you can get online easily these days. Back in the 80s, in far away New Zealand, the magazine was an authoritative source of scores and statistics, along with its small format sibling, the Cricketer Quarterly.",

It came in a hefty box, with dozens of cards but just a great heap of wooden cubes and discs to represent resources and player markers. A sensation in Germany, pent up demand for an English version meant that people bought the German version and used laminated paste ups as overlays and even for the cards, with (very well done) translations by fans. I got one of these paste-ups (and then the English version when it was released of course). But people wanted more. They were not satisfied with cubes for sheep, pigs and cattle and rumours started to swirl around about supplying wooden shapes instead, swiftly dubbed ‚Äúanimeeples‚Äù. Others couldn‚Äôt wait and started to brighten up their copies by making animals from Fimo or similar modelling clay. I had a go but was extremely poor at it, then I was lucky to score a complete set in a maths trade from an enthusiast who had made two complete sets and put one up for trade. For the period when Agricola ruled the roost we used these wonderful creations all the time. Now as well as starting a legendary line of continuously refined Uwe Rosenberg variations on farming/mining themes, Agricola could be said to have helped initiate the evolution of cubes into cute custom shapes! A landmark game.\n#bgg #boardgames #agricola #animeeples",

In the base game, since the biggest way to earn points is the board, you may not realise the power of card draw and of science. But since you add expansions, you really understand why card draw is the most powerful way to win a game. Yeah of course you have to build your productions and to make your economy snowball in the first gens, that‚Äôs why there are prelude and colonies, but after, using the board isn‚Äôt enough when there are big animal engines, much more jovian tags to earn points.... Btw the player getting IA central wins 9 games out of 10 because 2 free cards each turn is just bullshit. Moreover, another thing that TM players have to accept is that sometimes the game just doesn‚Äôt let you have the first place, sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt give the cards you need, and it happens, it‚Äôs an adaptation game, and you can still aim for the second place or for scoring as much as you can ! Anyway, always fun to draw a lot of cards, I had a fun games in which I was drawing around 10 cards per turn since I had a colony + research colony on Pluto to draw cards... that‚Äôs also why r√©duction on the cards‚Äô price is broken, and that‚Äôs why earth catapult or research outpost are way too strong in my opinion",

This meant I had to capture and register 400 different varieties of Pokemon, which involved a number of strategies, including hatching eggs, wonder trades and special trades with friends to evolve specific types. Even stranger niche activities included spinning on the spot while a Pokemon held a specific sweet, holding the Switch upside down while one levelled up and walking under an arch in the evening with an unhealthy Pokemon. I got to 399 out of the 400 required by Tuesday, and on Wednesday they launched Pokemon Home, which, amongst other things, lets you transfer Pokemon from earlier games, so I was able to transfer Mawile, a not particularly unusual Pokemon, but which had nevertheless eluded me, to complete the Pok√©dex. In a few months some additional expansion content will add another 200 or so to the Pok√©dex so I can start all over again!",

This time I took every opportunity to mine the Adventure deck and was lucky to find the Tattered Map which I hoarded until there were only 4 locations left. Luckily the Shrine was one of the 3 that I picked up with the Map, and the Shaman proved surprisingly easy to deal with. Phew. This really is minnow level adventuring though, as a reward for completing this and levelling up, we got to add a Rope, a Hammer and a Long Gambeson to our belongings!

Of course it was the Mother Spore which did for the Farmhand leaving the Forgehand to despatch it with 1 health remaining. Much time was used up recovering from this, only to encounter Goblin Shamans (Shamen?) in the next location and get reduced to 1 health again. At least the locations had a healthy population of the icons we were looking for. The time deck was pretty depleted by the time the adventurers lurched into the next two locations to conclude their search for wildlife. A Druach‚Äôs way is a hard one!

It needs 6 people so Chris, Kris, Jeff, Jean-Francois, Debbie and Matt were recruited as generals by Jeff and it was every bit as rewarding as I expected. Russia and Japan swooped back and forth across the Asia/Pacific region while the European powers engaged in more static activity, favouring careful Status card play. But once Japan overreached in India it started to go better for the good guys! I really enjoyed the experience, exactly the level of conflict style game that I can manage. #bgg #boardgames",

Then, going around the table, players must either play a card in their hand or back out of the mission. Each card represents either threats to the team (such as mortar shells and weather conditions) or negative personality traits (such as frightened or obsessive). At the end of the round, more cards are added to the draw deck. The game ends only if the players can deplete the draw deck as well as their hands without letting time run out.",

I did exhume some vintage Apple foam covers, probably from the original iPod. They were still sealed in the plastic pouch they were delivered in but were so fragile they simply fell apart when touched. The hack requires melting 4 small holes in the foam covers so that the sensors on the AirPods still work. With their foam jackets on the AirPods sit more firmly in the ear, dramatically improving the sound. To be clear they were never in danger of falling out of my ears but they are so slippery they shifted ever so slightly causing the ‚Äúideal‚Äù fit to be lost. The strange green tinge is because I used a green Sharpie to mark the spots to make my (extremely unsurgical) incisions.\n#airpods",

I also forgot to take a screen shot of the dramatic denouement of the first bout so had to mock it up for real. I was in a strong position with one Russian squad pinned and their group A reduced to one man, Private Petrovsky. But he had acquired a demo charge from a successful close combat and in a glorious Hail Mary move he flung it into the building where my main squad was. Game over. For a game that abstracts away much of the normal trappings of a war game this was surprisingly sticky, terrain wise, My Group A advanced through Brush, Brush and into a Building. Then retreated back through Brush while the Petrovsky crowd advanced into, you guessed it, a Building. All very tidy, narrative wise. After all these years it retains all the things I used to like about it, as well as the problematic ones, including the theme, which, let‚Äôs face it, isn‚Äôt farming‚Ä¶\n#bgg #boardgames #upfront",

She is much tougher, especially if your party is woefully unbalanced. Still, we thought it might be possible and we managed to cheese our way through, with some outrageously silly tactics, including running her Milotic out of PP, then readying Gengar with X Speed to inflict TOXIC on her Garchomp and try to outlast it. As it happened she used a Full Restore, but Mew was able to hold on for the win. Not so much a difficulty spike as a difficulty mountain. Fun to puzzle it out though. #pokemon #pokemonbdsp",

The list you see above also contains a few games I played against an AI, in my ultimately misguided challenge to myself to play 10 games 10 times on the iPad. The only one I finished 10 times was Wingspan, some of the others turned out to be too intense to tackle in a year when my brain spent a lot of time befogged.\n\nNew games to us during the year included Cubitos, an excellent racing game involving cheeses in lederhosen, and other strange things; Imperium Classics and Legends, a very interesting take on Civ style games with excellent solo mode; Llamaland, a fun little puzzle game of laying out lands to attract llamas; and The Siege of Runedar, a thoroughly excellent co-op game by Reiner Knizia.\n#bgg #boardgames",
